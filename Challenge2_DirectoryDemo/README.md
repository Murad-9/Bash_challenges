# Challenge 2: File Operations

This Bash script automates basic directory and file creation.

## What the script does
- Creates a directory called 'Bash_demo'
- Navigates into the directory
- Creates a file named 'demo.txt'
- Writes text to the file including the current date
- Displays the contents of the file

## Concepts practiced
- Directory and file creation with 'mkdir, touch'
- Using redirection '>'
- Using 'date +%'
- Displaying file contents with 'cat'

## Notes
This challenge reinforced my knowledge on how Bash can automate repetitive file system tasks
