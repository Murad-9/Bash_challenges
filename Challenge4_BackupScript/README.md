# Challenge 4: Backup script for text files

This Bash script backs up all '.txt' files from a user-specified directory.

## What the script does
- Prompts the user for a source directory
- Creates a backup directory with a timestamp
- Copies all '.txt' files into the backup directory
- Displays how many files were backed up

## Concepts practiced
- Directory validation with '-d'
- Using timestamps with 'date'
- Copying files with 'cp'
- Counting files with 'ls' and 'wc'
- Basic automation logic

## Notes
This challenge improved my understanding of scripting for real-world automation tasks.
