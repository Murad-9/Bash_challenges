# Challenge 3: File checker with permissions

This Bash script checks wether a file exists and displays its permissions.

## What the script does
- Prompts the user to enter a filename
- Checks if the file exists
- If it exists, checks wether the file is:
  - Readable
  - Writable
  - Executable
- Prints clear messages for each condition

## Concepts practices
- File tests ( -e , -f , -w , -x )
- Conditional logic with 'if'
- User input handling

## Notes
This challenge helped me understand file permissions and conditional checks within Bash.
